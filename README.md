## 🧠 How Mathly Works

1. User inputs an equation or selects an operation.  
2. The expression is parsed using **SymPy** for symbolic computation.  
3. **Matplotlib** and **NumPy** generate real-time visualizations.  
4. Results are displayed instantly through the **Streamlit web interface**.

This makes Mathly ideal for students, developers and data enthusiasts to test, visualize and understand mathematical concepts interactively.
